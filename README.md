A Social Bookmarking App

  Thrillio is a social bookmarking app that uses the object oriented features of java programming language to provide functionality.
  
  Features of this app include - 
  
    1. This app provides different access levels for different users.
    2. This app can bookmark movies, books and weblinks.
    3. This app also has a feature to mark specific bookmarks as kid friendly.
    4. Furthermore, it has a feature to share those kid-friendly bookmarks with its partner website.
    
  For some features I've used test-driven approach to create unit tests.
